Longdash
========

A stretched [Lodash](https://lodash.com/). Lodash uses a single `_`. We use two. :sunglasses:

All beautiful methods from Lodash are inherited. To access them, just use our stretched dash (`__`). Please, check Lodash's [docs](https://lodash.com/docs) for its methods.

Besides that, *Longdash* adds several modules to extend Lodash, keeping a single namespace of JS goodies in your project. The purpose here is to keep you [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), avoiding writing repetitive code. 'Cause now you got a huge collection of helpful code snippets.

### Install with Bower
