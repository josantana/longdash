Longdash
========

A stretched [Lodash](https://lodash.com/). Lodash uses a single `_`. We use two.

All helpful methods from Lodash are inherited. To access them, just use our stretched dash (`__`). Please, check Lodash's [docs](https://lodash.com/docs) for their methods.

*Longdash* adds several modules to extend Lodash, keeping a single namespace of JS goodies in your project. The purpose here is to keep you [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), avoiding writing repetitive code.

Now you got covered by this huge collection of code snippets.

### Install with Bower

You can install and manage *Longdash* versions using [Bower](http://bower.io).

```
$ bower install longdash
```

### Dependencies

- [Lodash](https://lodash.com/)
- [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/)

These libraries are not bundled with *Longdash*. Include them before calling *Longdash*.

### Documentation

Please, read our [documentation](https://josantana.gitbooks.io/longdash/content/) for more information about all our modules and how to use them in your projects.
