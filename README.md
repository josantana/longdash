=======

A stretched [Lodash](https://lodash.com/). Lodash uses a single `_`. We use two. :sunglasses:

*Longdash* adds several modules to extend Lodash, keeping a single namespace of JS goodies in your project. The purpose here is to keep you [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), avoiding writing repetitive code.

All helpful methods from Lodash are inherited. To access them, just use our stretched dash (`__`) followed by the methods group name.

Smile! We got you covered by this huge collection of code snippets. :grinning:

### Documentation

Please, read our [documentation](https://josantana.gitbooks.io/longdash/content/) for more information about all our modules and how to use them in your projects.

*Available in English (__EN__) and Portuguese (__PT-BR__).*
